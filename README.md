Excel-based analysis of bike purchasers with interactive dashboards and insights.

## Bike Buyer Purchasers Analysis

This project showcases the skills Iâ€™ve developed through the DSA Data Analytics program. Using Excel, I analyzed bike purchaser data to extract meaningful insights and created an interactive dashboard to visualize the findings.

### Project Overview

The dataset includes details such as gender, commute distance, region, occupation, marital status, age, income, and more.

### Excel Dashboard

I built three pivot tables and combined them into an interactive dashboard using slicers for easy filtering and exploration.

#### Analysis Highlights:
- Average income segmented by gender (male vs. female)
- Commute distance from home to workplace
- Age distribution of buyers by bracket

#### Excel Features Used:
- Pivot Tables  
- Slicers (synchronized across pivot tables)  
- Formulas (IF statements, Find and Replace, Nested IFs, etc.)  
- Dashboard layout and design principles
